Here are a few facts that I think are the most revealing:',
    facts:
      "<ul><li>I graduated from RS School | JavaScript/Front-end in <active>35th place out of ~11,500 </active>registered users, starting from scratch. I graduated from RS School | React in <active>1st place out of ~550</active> students. This does not characterize my code, but characterizes my purposefulness</li><li>I was a team leader in all school team tasks. Each of these works fell into the list of the best works of the course. <active>I can work in a team and organize people</active></li><li><active>I am 32</active>. This means that I start the project on the day it is issued. I don't panic. I don’t ask every little thing, but I’m not afraid to come up with a question if necessary. I’m an adult and I understand how much this simplifies the work)</li></ul>",
